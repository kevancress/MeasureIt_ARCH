For MeasureIt_ARCH I consider all of the following to be bugs that should be reported: Blender Crashes when using MeasureIt_ARCH Blender Reports an Error in the Info Editor when using MeasureIt_ARCH A MeasureIt_ARCH tool produces an unexpected or unintutive result ( that isn't clearly described in the docs ) Example an Area Dimension Text isn't centered properly, the Add Dimension Button occaisionally produces a duplicate Dimension A MeasureIt_ARCH property behaves in an unexpected way You can't find a feature or property where it is described in the docs A feature or property isn't documented Essentially if there's anything that makes you think \"huh thats not what I expected would happen\" then I'd like to hear about it. Anything that make you think 'I really wish it did <Somthing new>' is a feature request, and I'd like to hear those too, but check out the \"Requesting Features\" page for Feature Request Guidelines. Where to Report Issues Issues should be reported in the GitHub Issue Tracker . Warning MeasureIt_ARCH does have a Youtube page and a Twitter account , but the GitHub issue tracker is the only source that I regularly check when working on Issues. If you report an issue to my youtube or twitter account it will likely be lost and forgotten. What to Include in an Issue Report A usefull error report should contain the following: A descriptive Title A brief description of what you were doing when the error occured The Version of Blender you are using The Operating system you are using The Version of MeasureIt_ARCH you are using Info MeasureIt_ARCH now displays detailed version info at the bottom of the \"MeasureIt_ARCH Settings\" Panel in Blender's Scene Properties.

MeasureIt_ARCH is meant for producing Design Documentation and Technical Drawings in Blender. If you've been using Sketch-Up, AutoCAD, Rhino or somthing similar for design drawings and documentation, on relativly small scale projects, then MeasureIt_ARCH & Blender could be a good tool for you. Why should I use MeasureIt_ARCH? I'm looking for Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools in Blender? If you're looking for BIM functionality, the BlenderBIM team has you covered. BlenderBIM adds support for working with BIM data based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard . Check out the BlenderBIM website and documentation for more information. Where can I learn about other tools for Archtectural and Technical drawing with Open Source Software? Check out the OSArch wiki and website for more information on Open Source tools. SVG export is great, but my Clients expect PDF's! A PDF exporter is a high priority for future development. In the meantime MeasureIt_ARCH comes with a .bat file utility to quickly convert .svg's to .pdf's with the help of Inkscape . Check out the \"Batch convert .svg to .pdf\" tutorial to learn how to set-up and use the .bat file. PDF's are great, but my Consultants expect CAD files! A reality of the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is that we need to share information quickly, often, and in the formats that the rest of the industry expects. Unfortunaly if you're working on a project with many consultants that need to exchange tightly co-ordinated CAD files (or work with centralized BIM information), then MeasureIt_ARCH is likely not a good fit for your project right now. That said, MeasureIt_ARCH does have a (partially) functioning .dxf exporter, along with some options for configuring CAD layer setting. This is a work in progress, but does allow for drawings to be exported to AutoCAD when needed, although this process is currently far from seamless. MeasureIt_ARCH, is that related to MeasureIt? Indeed it is! MeasureIt is an addon that is included as part of blender, originally developed by Antonio Vazquez, who is now developing Blender's Grease Pencil tools. MeasureIt_ARCH started off as a fork of the MeasureIt addon in 2019. While the original intent was simply to add an option for line drawings to MeasureIt, MeasureIt_ARCH has since developed into a suite of tools for Dimensioning, Line Drawing, Annotations, View Management, Styles, and Vector Graphics, with a redesigned UI as well. Disclaimer No one has actually asked me these questions, but I do ask them to myself. Frequently.

Each line group assigned to an object can have its own style or line settings. Adding Line Groups (MeasureIt_ARCH Main Panel) Buttons for adding Line Groups to an object can be found in the MeasureIt_ARCH main panel, in the 3D viewport. You can also access these operators by search for their name in Blender's the Operator Search menu (F3) . Dynamic Line Group(Object Mode Only) Creates a Line Group from any edges sharper than a user specified crease angle. This Line Group will refresh automatically whenever changes are made to the model, and can work with geometry generated by Blender's Modifiers or Geometry Nodes. The Line Group is recalculate when entering and exiting Edit Mode. Line Group by Selection (Edit Mode Only) Creates a Line Group from selected edges. Select the desired edges in edit mode and press the Line button. Warning Selection based line groups are maintained for backwards compatibility, but are not reccomended, as they will often break when mesh vertex indices change. If you need more precise control over Dynamic Line Groups, try the \"Filter Group\" setting to limit dynamic line groups to a specific Vertex Group. Line Style (Color Swatch Icon): Sets the Style to be assigned to a new Line Group on creation. Line Group List (Object Settings) The Line Group List lets you select and edit the properties of the line groups attached to the actively selected object. Color : Sets Line Group Color.

Titleblocks can be used to set common elements that are present in multiple views. Typically Titleblocks contain a page border, project name, revision history, and other relevent information, as well as the designers information. How do MeasureIt_ARCH Titleblocks Work? MeasureIt_ARCH Titleblocks are defined in a titleblock scene (a new Blender scene that only contains the titleblock). Once a Titleblock has been defined, any view in the main scene can reference the Titleblock scene (set in the views Titleblock property) and will draw that Titleblock scene in the Views Camera Space. A MeasureIt_ARCH Titleblock can contain any MeasureIt_ARCH element, but Annotations with AutoFill Text setup can be particularly usefull. With AutoFill Text, the same titleblock can be used for many views, but text for view specific properties (Drawing Number, Drawing Name, Scale etc.) will be automattically updated to be correct for the current view. Creating a Titleblock in MeasureIt_ARCH To set up a titleblock in MeasureIt_ARCH, create a new scene, and name it somthing recongnizable and descriptive. Note Titleblocks ususally correspond to a particular designer and page size, it's helpful to indicate both of these in the Scene name, so it can be easily located later In the titleblock scene, draw your titleblock using MeasureIt_ARCH Element. The titleblock must be drawn at 1:1 Scale, on the XY plane centered at the scene origin, to work correctly. Note The titleblock scene will be drawn in the view camera's local space, aligned to the near clipping plane, this means that any objects placed above the origin (Positive on the Z axis) will clipped. Be sure to locate all titleblock elements with a Z height of 0 or less. It's not necessary, but it can be helpful to create a View with a down facing camera in the titleblock scene, with the Paper Size and 1:1 Scale set so you can preview your titleblock from this camera view. Using a Titleblock Once you've created a titleblock, you can set it in the Titleblock property in a View in your main scene. The Titleblock you specifiy will be instanced, aligned to the views camera, at the cameras near clipping plane. Warning Cameras with a very small near clipping value, or a very large far clipping value, sometimes won't draw titleblocks properly.
