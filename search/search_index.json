Show / Hide MeasureIt_ARCH Toggle Shows and hides all items created by MeasureIt_ARCH. Selected Object Only Toggle (Ghost Icon) When disabled, MeasureIt_ARCH will only show elements attached to the currently selected objects. Highlight Active (Cursor & Eye Icon) When enabled, the active MeasureIt_ARCH element will be highlighted in Blender's selection color. Show Gizmos (Arrow Icon) When enabled MeasureIt_ARCH will show gizmos for all elements attached to the selected object. Add Dimensions Aligned Adds an Aligned Dimension between 2 Objects or Vertices. Object Mode: Select two objects and then press the Aligned Button. Edit Mode: Select two or more Vertices and press the Aligned Button. Axis Adds a Dimension that measures along a single Axis between 2 Objects or Vertices. Object Mode: Select two objects and then press the Aligned Button. Edit Mode: Select two or more Vertices and press the Aligned Button. Axis Selection : Picks the axes to be dimensioned on creation. Bounds (Object Mode Only) Adds a set of Dimensions that measure the Bounding Box of the selected object Axis Selection : Picks the bounding box axis to be displayed on creation. Angle (Edit Mode Only) Adds an Angle Dimension for 3 selected vertices. The 2nd vertex selected defines the corner of the angle. Arc (Edit Mode Only) Adds an Arc Dimension circumscribing the 3 selected vertices. Area (Edit Mode Only) Adds an Area Dimension to the selected faces. The Area Dimension text will be placed at the center of the bounding box of the active face. Dimension Style (Color Swatch Icon) Selects a Style to be assigned to new dimensions on creation. View Plane (Axis Icon) Lets you select the preferred view plain for new dimensions (used to automatically place dimensions on creation). XY Plane (Plan View) : Dimensions placed to be viewed from the top or bottom. YZ Plane (Section/ Elevation View) : Dimensions placed to be viewed from the left or right. XZ Plane (Section/ Elevation View) : Dimensions placed to be viewed from the front or back.

Evaluate Depsgraph Evaluate Blender's Dependency Graph before drawing MeasureIt_ARCH elements. WARNING : By default, MeasureIt_ARCH does not evaluate the Dependency Graph to improve performance and because some generative modifiers can give unpredictable results. Enabling this setting will make MeasureIt_ARCH attempt to evaluate these modifiers during its calculations. It can be slow and give unexpected results. This can be enabled for individual elements as well, please only enable this for the whole scene if absolutely necessary Use Text Autoplacement Automatically move dimension text to the outside of the dimension line if it is too large to fit within. Default Resolution Resolution to use for text rendering if no view resolution has been defined Debug Text Writes Dimension Text to an image for Debug Debug Text Cards Draw Dimension Text Cards for Debug Enable Experimental Enable Experimental Features in MeasureIt_ARCH Instance Dimensions Will Enable Dimension Instancing. WARNING : Text on instanced Dimensions will not account for changes in the instances local scale or rotation.

WARNING : If 'Save Render to Output' is not enabled the rendered image will only be stored in an image data-block within Blender. MeasureIt_ARCH Animation Renders the full frame range of the current scene. Animation Renders can be Cancelled with the Esc key, or by Right Clicking in the 3D View. A 3D Viewport window must be open for MeasureIt_ARCH to render animations. Animation frames will be saved to the Output path defined in the Render Panel. MeasureIt_ARCH Vector Renders an SVG drawing of the current view. Embed Scene Render: embeds a raster rendering of the scene as the background of the SVG Vector Z Order: Orders the drawing of vector elements by the object origin's Z height.
