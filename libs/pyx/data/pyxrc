# This file is an example containing the runtime configuration options
# of PyX and its default values. You may copy it to ~/.pyxrc for personal
# configuration.

[general]
# general options

# Some options can contain several values and the space character is
# used by default to separate several values. In case the space
# character is needed itself as part of the values, you can set an
# unused replacement string to encode the space character being
# part of the value. By default 'SPACE' is this magic string:
space = SPACE

[text]
# runtime configuration of the text module

# 'tex' specifies the TeX executable and defaults to 'tex'.
tex = tex

# 'latex' specifies the LaTeX executable and defaults to 'latex'.
latex = latex

# 'psfontmaps' is a whitespace separated list of options listing font
# mapping files. Those files contain information about the available
# type1 fonts. Depending on your TeX-installation you may need to add
# further font mapping files like psfonts.cmz (if your TeX installation
# is not configured to use type1 fonts by default). For further
# information browse the FAQ for the term 'font mapping file'.
psfontmaps = psfonts.map

# 'pdffontmaps' is similar to psfontmaps, but used when pdf output
# is generated. (Note that pdf has a different set of builtin fonts.)
pdffontmaps = pdftex.map

# 'wait' is an positive integer. It is the number of seconds
# to be waited for an appropriate response from TeX/LaTeX.
wait = 60

# 'showwait' is an non-negative integer. It is the number of
# seconds to be waited until (and between) emitting messages
# indicating the waiting for an appropriate response from TeX/LaTeX.
# This feature can be turned off by setting showwaitfortex to 0.
showwait = 5

# 'texipc' is a boolean controlling the usage of the --ipc option of
# TeX/LaTeX. You should turn on this option when the ipc-extension is
# available in your TeX installation (check the output of tex --help).
# You will gain immediate access to the dvi-output of TeX by that,
# which will substantially improve the performance of certain
# operations (e.g. the usage of PyX markers).
texipc = 0

[filelocator]
# runtime configuration of file search mechanism

# 'methods' defines a list of methods to be tried one after each other
# to find files like, e.g., fonts and corresponding metrics information.
#
# Available methods are:
# - 'local': locates files in the current directory.
# - 'internal': locates files within the PyX data tree (works inside
#               of zipped Python eggs too)
# - 'recursivedir': locates files by searching recursively in a
#                   space-separated list of directories, which can
#                   be specified by the option 'recursivedir'.
# - 'ls-R': locates files by searching a list of ls-R files,
#           which can be specified by the option 'ls-R'.
# - 'pykpathsea': locate files using the pykpathsea extension if available.
#                 Building of this module can be enabled in the setup.cfg
#                 file distributed with PyX.
# - 'kpsewhich': locate files using the kpsewhich executable if available.
#                The name of the executable can be set by the 'kpsewhich'
#                option and defaults to 'kpsewhich'.
# - 'locate': locate files using a locate executable if available.
#             The name of the executable can be set by the 'locate'
#             option and defaults to 'locate'.
methods = local internal pykpathsea kpsewhich
